# Contributing to PySmith

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We welcome bug reports, feature requests,
documentation improvements, and code contributions.

Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your change.
2. Write tests that cover the new behavior or bug fix.
3. Run tests locally and ensure they pass.
4. Open a pull request describing the change and why it is needed.

PR checklist:

- [ ] Tests are included (where appropriate)
- [ ] Code follows existing style and is well-documented
- [ ] README and docs updated if public behavior changed
- [ ] CI passes

If you're unsure where to start, check the `issues` list for good-first-issues or
open a discussion/issue describing what you'd like to work on.
